# ECE-128-LAB9

Problem:
Design a switch Debouncer. Write a Verilog code and program on the board. Use a push button as input pulse and use a LED to display the output(20pts). 

Design a 4-bit (1100) sequence with Moore machine. Write a Verilog code and testbench for it. Simulate the waveform and analyze the result. (35pts). 

Design a 4-bit (1101) sequence with mealy-overlapping machine. Write a Verilog code and testbench for it. Simulate the waveform and analyze the result.  (35pts).
